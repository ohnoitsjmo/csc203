// Methods that won't be moved or can be put in multiple classes
executeAnimationAction() and executeActivityAction() are methods that can be put in multiple classes. I chose to put them in the Action class because they are both a type of action, and methods are only called on action from within these methods.
executeMinerFullActivity(), executeMinerNotFullActivity(), executeOreActivity(), executeOreBlobActivity(), executeQuakeActivity(), executeVeinActivity(), findNearest(), transformNotFull(), transformFull(), createActivityAction(), moveToOreBlob(), createActivityAction(), transformNotFull(), transformFull(), moveToFull(), moveToNotFull(), nextPositionMiner(), nextPositionOreBlob() are all methods that can be put in multiple classes, but I put them in Entity because all of them call and include methods that call Entity.
removePendingEvent() and unscheduleAllEvents() are both methods that can be put in multiple classes but I put them in EventScheduler because both methods relate to event scheduling.
isOccupied() and getOccupant() are methods that can be put in multiple classes but I put it in WorldModel because they deemed more appropriate than being in class Point.
clamp(), processImageLine(), loadImages(), setAlpha(), getCurrentImage(), parseBackground(), parseMinder(), parseObstacle(), parseOre(), parseSmith(), parseVein(), load(), and processLine() are all methods that will be left in functions because they don't need to be called within a specific class.
